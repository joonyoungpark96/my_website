# Justin Park

I am **Justin Park**, also go by JoonYoung. Iâ€™m from South Korea originally, but I spent about half of my life in Singapore and now the UK. Growing up in these countries, I was able to get a first-hand view of some major economic crises such as IMF crisis in Korea and 2009 global financial crisis, and became interested in some complicated economic phenomena and the governmental role in the economy and the financial markets. So I came to the UK to study Economics in Warwick.

#### Education
* **London Business School** MSc Financial Analysis
* **The University of Warwick** BSc Economics
